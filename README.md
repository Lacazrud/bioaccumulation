Bioaccumulation is the process by which a toxin or heavy metal accumulates within a
living organism. Biomagnification describes the process whereby toxin moves up the food chain
in progressively greater concentration due to ingestion. The bioaccumulation and
biomagnification of mercury in aquatic organisms such as fish and shrimp is of concern, since it
can lead to adverse effects for humans once consumed. In an attempt to analyse the impact of
mercury in a marine population, we propose a model to predict the effects and concentration of
mercury in a ternary fish-fish-algae ecosystem. Our results conclude that larger organisms
suffer a greater decrease in population due to the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of
mercury. In addition, the stable population density that was achieved before introducing mercury
was easily destroyed due to mercury. Interestingly, this results in a slight increase in the
population of prey species. In order to fully validate our model, we suggest that real-world
experiments ought to be conducted which seek to determine mercury levels and biodiversity in
aquatic ecosystems.
